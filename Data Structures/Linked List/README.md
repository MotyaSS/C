My very first code on github. A great one to start with!

Bidirectoinal linked list on C
-create list
-delete list
-push back, push forward
-add an elment after an element with certain index
-delete an element by its index
-check if list is empty
-get list's length
-print list

Uses ComplexNumber as its value

what can be added?
-swapping two elements
-copying lists
-use c++ template functionality
